# 🤖 RAG for Robotic Decision-Making  

🚀 A **hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system** integrating **FAISS-based vector search** and **Knowledge Graphs** to enhance **NLP-driven robotic decision-making** for autonomous systems.

---

## 📌 Overview  

This project enables **UGVs and robotic arms** to:  
✅ **Process natural language queries** related to troubleshooting, task execution, and operational workflows.  
✅ **Retrieve knowledge from robotic manuals, safety protocols, and execution logs** using **FAISS for fast similarity search**.  
✅ **Leverage Knowledge Graphs for structured reasoning**, improving interpretability and inference.  
✅ **Enable real-time task adaptation** through a **ROS-compatible API (supports ROS1 & ROS2)**, allowing seamless **human-robot collaboration**.

## 🚀 How It Works  

### 1️⃣ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Robotics**  
🔹 FAISS retrieves relevant documents from **robotic manuals & execution logs** based on **semantic similarity**.  
🔹 The **Knowledge Graph provides structured reasoning**, helping robots understand workflows and dependencies.  
🔹 A **fine-tuned RAG model (`facebook/rag-token-nq`, GPT-based embeddings)** generates contextual responses.  

### 2️⃣ **Query Processing Example**  
```python
from src.rag_pipeline import RAGModel

model = RAGModel()
response = model.answer_query("How do I recalibrate my robotic arm?")
print(response)
```

### 3️⃣ **ROS-Compatible API for Robotic Integration**  
Start the robot NLP interface:  
```bash
roslaunch rag_robot_interface start.launch
```

Send a command to the robot:  
```python
import rospy
from std_msgs.msg import String

rospy.init_node("robot_command")
pub = rospy.Publisher("/robot_commands", String, queue_size=10)
pub.publish("Check motor torque levels")
```

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics  

The system is evaluated based on:  
✅ **BLEU & ROUGE scores** for text generation quality.  
✅ **Recall@K for retrieval effectiveness**.  
✅ **Response latency for real-time execution**.

## 🔥 Future Improvements  
🚀 **Multi-modal RAG (Images + Text) for vision-based robotic queries**  
🚀 **Enhanced Knowledge Graph for deeper reasoning**  
🚀 **Real-time learning from robot interactions**
